I have started a fundraiser called Art for Aleppo in response to the
horrific news and video of the refugees and children affected by the
civil war in Syria.

Attached please see the call to artists.  It will describe the project
fully.

I am donating all money to Save the Children Syria. And I am looking
to announce this in a couple of weeks as the show is in March.  I was
hoping to appeal to you to possibly help by donating your talent to
get a website together to facilitate this idea.  Any money required
(which so far has been extremely minimal) is coming directly out of
pocket so I really don't have a budget to work with.

I could build it myself but I am not sure I could get it done properly
and don't want a debacle!  anyway...I have the domain artforaleppo.org
already.

I would need:

- A home page describing the "call" and the situation in Syria (with a
possible CNN video link or something informative regarding the
subject)

- Info on Save the Children Syria

- A optional link to donate directly, without submitting art, to Save
 the Children Syria (working on talking to them about setting up
 something for us)

- 2 emails: info@artforaleppo, and submissions@artforaleppo

- A page to post the submissions on..like a gallery.

- An about us page

From a high level it sounds like what we need is

1. A single page website for starters with all the info. 
2. Then we'll need a way to show all the art.
3. Will we need a way to collect donations?  Perhaps the Save the Children Syria, can provide away to sent money directly to it, verse having a bank account and what not.
4. What else?

I've got some servers.  I can throw something together for (1) fairly quickly.  Will you design it with photoshop?

trying to not handle any money so Sav the Childeren will hopefully accommodate this.


I can give you the AFA image hi res 
the logo separate
the images separate 
and all the info on the Call doc. will work ( i need to change format from A4 card to and A6 with inches and CM specs)

I am getting a PO BOX this week

If we set up emails mentioned: 
Info@AFA.org 
Submit@AFA.org
let say..where do those go/ do I have to get 2 google accounts that receive it or is that part of your server?

guess we should design it into a WP template?
basically an info driven site nothing fancy.

Are you partnering with Catalyst?  Or are you renting the space for a Month?

What's the price point for the art?
