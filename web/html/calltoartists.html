  <h4>OPEN CALL TO ARTISTS</h4>
  <h4>Postcard Art Show in support of the Children of Aleppo</h4>
  <p>In response to the overwhelming sentiments toward the horrific news and video surfacing around the atrocities in Aleppo, particularly in regard to the children affected, we would like to initialize an open call for artists from around the world to respond.</p>

  <p>The intention of this call is to allow visual artists an outlet to express themselves around the Syrian crisis and to raise awareness and funds to aid in the effort to provide Syrian children emergency care, food and water.</p>

  <p>As artists ourselves and considering the reactions by other artists to this tragedy, we felt that this call to action might be a way to give voice to the community in order to raise awareness and hopefully have the potential to heal in some way. Additionally, any sales or donations will go toward the Save the Children Syrian Children's Relief Fund.</p>
    
  <p>Donate to the Syrian Children's Relief Fund</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a piece of art on <u><strong>A6 (international size 148 x 105 mm or 5.8 x 4.1 inches)</strong></u> post card.
  <strong>It does not need to be on paper. Use your imagination in materials. If it’s the size of an A6 postcard and postage will stick to it and you can put an address on it, then we will accept it. (wood, metal, plexiglas etc. are acceptable)</strong></li>
    <li>Write a short statement on the back (optional). It can be about Aleppo or war or freedom or whatever moves you. Feel free to write a poem or a word etc. We leave it to your imagination.</li>
