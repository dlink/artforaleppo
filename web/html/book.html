     We thought that it would be a nice idea to photograph each
     postcard / work of art and include the photo along with the
     artist’s name and website in a book we will put together on
     Blurb.com (an on demand self-publishing site.)  Anyone can order
     a copy of the book directly from blurb.com’s website. All
     proceeds from the sale of the book and the sale of the donated
     art postcard will go directly to
   
     <a href="http://www.savethechildren.org/refugee/artforaleppo" target="_blank">Save the Children Syria</a>.
     
     The catalog book of participating
     artists images will be available online with blurb.com titled:
     "Art For Aleppo" beginning on April 20th. Blurb is a self
     publishing on demand book forum online so there is never a waste
     of paper or upfront costs for Art For Aleppo. This allows us as
     artists in this project to create without spending donations on
     production or administration.</p>
