       The battle for Aleppo is marked by widespread violence against
      civilians, repeated targeting of hospitals and schools, and
      indiscriminate aerial strikes and shelling against civilian
      areas. Hundreds of thousands of residents have been displaced by
      the fighting and efforts to provide aid to civilians or
      facilitate evacuation is routinely disrupted. After four years
      of fighting, the battle represents one of the longest sieges in
      modern warfare. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR)
      registered that in 1612 days of fighting <strong>21,452
      civilians died</strong>. Among them were <strong>5,261
      children</strong> under the age of 18. <strong>We want to help
      and so can you!</strong> The Art For Aleppo project gives visual
      artists an outlet to express themselves around the Syrian crisis
      and help raise awareness and funds to aid in the effort to
       provide Syrian children emergency care, food and water.

      The Art For Aleppo project also gives non artists a chance to
      help in three ways, through the purchase of art, through the
      purchase of the catalog book of participating artists or through
      a direct monetary donation in any amount.

       <strong>You may donate
      (<a href="/donate.py">Donation Here</a>) at any time or submit
      to the call (<a href="/calltoartists.py">Open Call</a>) by April 15th,
      2017</strong>.
