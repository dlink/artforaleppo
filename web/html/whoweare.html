	   Russ Ritell was born 40 minutes north of NYC. An
       illustration & design major, Russ graduated from the School of
       Visual Arts, and has been working professionally as a designer
       / animator for the past 17 years. This profession has allowed
       Russ to grow by expanding his artistic abilities to include
       animation, video and technical knowledge into recent
       projects. A father of two girls, Russell finds time to work,
       passionately, on paintings and conceptual work at his home
       studio in Cold Spring, NY. Although he has explored other
       mediums to communicate his ideas, Ritell is primarily a
       painter. Most recently his paintings combine a realistic
       observation of the human physical and emotional states using
       high contrast lighting to vividly express scenes of physical
       and psychological reality. This work is powerful in creating a
       mood, and seem to capture a dramatic, even theatrical moments
       in time.  Ritell’s current series of oil paintings are directly
       influenced by the artwork of Caravaggio. In some cases he has
       intentionally emulated the artist’s composition & lighting by
       referencing and “contemporizing” the subject matter from his
       paintings. In Gorgon the tattooist is actually branding the
       subject with a Caravaggio image. The Medusa head (Gorgon) on
       his shoulder gives homage to the artist and acts as an “inside
       joke” or a direct clue referencing the original painting. Russ
       has exhibited his work in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Harlem, New
       Jersey and the Hudson
       Valley.  <a href="http://www.russritell.com"

       Carla Goldberg is a Mixed-Media Visual Artist. Her works have
       been exhibited in museums, universities and galleries
       worldwide, including The Tabernacle, MOMA Wales, Brooklyn
       Waterfront Museum and the Dolmabahce Palace (State Gallery)
       Istanbul, Turkey.  Most recently she exhibited in New York City
       with both Tria Gallery and Denise Bibro Fine Art. In May of
       2012, Carla exhibited with Kunstleben- Berlin, Germany where
       she has gallery representation. Her solo at Southwestern
       Minnesota State University Art Museum resulted in the
       acquisition of her work into their permanent collection hanging
       alongside works by Dali, Picasso and Toulouse-Lautrec,
       Hundertwaser and Miotte. Goldberg graduated with honors from
       the University of Redlands, California where she studied under
       esteemed figurative painter John Nava and studied under the
       noted artist Sal Scarpitta at MICA’s Mount Royal Graduate
       School of Art where she received her MFA degree. For the past
       six years, Carla has worked primarily with resins and water
       concepts. She combines these non-traditional, industrial
       materials with traditional art mediums where her inventiveness
       pushes her materials constantly into new forms. The resulting
       work is at once intricate and bold yet ethereal.
