	   Russ graduated from the School of Visual Arts, and has been
       working professionally as a designer / animator for the past 17
       years. This profession has allowed Russ to grow by expanding
       his artistic abilities to include animation, video and
       technical knowledge into recent projects. A father of two
       girls, Russell finds time to work, passionately, on paintings
       and conceptual work at his home studio in Cold Spring,
       NY. Although he has explored other mediums to communicate his
       ideas, Ritell is primarily a painter. Most recently his
       paintings combine a realistic observation of the human physical
       and emotional states using high contrast lighting to vividly
       express scenes of physical and psychological reality. This work
       is powerful in creating a mood, and seem to capture a dramatic,
       even theatrical moments. Russ has exhibited his work in
       Manhattan, Brooklyn, Harlem, New Jersey and the Hudson
       Valley.  <a href="http://www.russritell.com"

       Carla Goldberg is a Mixed-Media Visual Artist. Her works have
       been exhibited in museums, universities and galleries
       worldwide, including The Tabernacle, MOMA Wales, Brooklyn
       Waterfront Museum and the Dolmabahce Palace (State Gallery)
       Istanbul, Turkey.  Most recently she exhibited in New York City
       with both Tria Gallery and Denise Bibro Fine Art. In May of
       2012, Carla exhibited with Kunstleben- Berlin, Germany where
       she has gallery representation. Her solo at Southwestern
       Minnesota State University Art Museum resulted in the
       acquisition of her work into their permanent collection hanging
       alongside works by Dali, Picasso and Toulouse-Lautrec,
       Hundertwaser and Miotte. Goldberg graduated with honors from
       the University of Redlands, California where she studied under
       esteemed figurative painter John Nava and studied under the
       noted artist Sal Scarpitta at MICAâ€™s Mount Royal Graduate
       School of Art where she received her MFA degree. For the past
       six years, Carla has worked primarily with resins and water
       concepts. She combines these non-traditional, industrial
       materials with traditional art mediums where her inventiveness
       pushes her materials constantly into new forms. The resulting
       work is at once intricate and bold yet ethereal.
