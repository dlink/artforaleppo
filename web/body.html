     <p>The battle for Aleppo is marked by widespread violence against
      civilians, repeated targeting of hospitals and schools, and
      indiscriminate aerial strikes and shelling against civilian
      areas. Hundreds of thousands of residents have been displaced by
      the fighting and efforts to provide aid to civilians or
      facilitate evacuation is routinely disrupted. After four years
      of fighting, the battle represents one of the longest sieges in
      modern warfare. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR)
      registered that in 1612 days of fighting <strong>21,452
      civilians died</strong>. Among them were <strong>5,261
      children</strong> under the age of 18. <strong>We want to
      help</strong>. The intention of Art For Aleppo is to allow
      visual artists an outlet to express themselves around the Syrian
      crisis and to raise awareness and funds to aid in the effort to
      provide Syrian children emergency care, food and
      water. <strong>You may donate (<a href="/?p=5">See to Make a
      Donation</a>) at any time or submit to the call
      (<a href="/?p=3">See Open call to Artists</a>) by March1, 2017.
      Artwork will be displayed at Catalyst Gallery in Beacon and
      exist for purchase online. All monies go directly to Save the
      Children Syria.</strong></p>
