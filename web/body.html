   <p>The battle for Aleppo is marked by widespread violence against
   civilians, repeated targeting of hospitals and schools, and
   indiscriminate aerial strikes and shelling against civilian
   areas. Hundreds of thousands of residents have been displaced by
   the fighting and efforts to provide aid to civilians or facilitate
   evacuation is routinely disrupted. After four years of fighting,
   the battle represents one of
   the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sieges"
   target="_blank"> longest sieges</a> in modern
   warfare. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Observatory_for_Human_Rights"
   target="_blank">Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</a> (SOHR)
   registered that in1612 days of fighting 21,452 civilians
   died. Among them were 5,261 children under the age of
   18. <strong>We want to help.</strong> The intention of Art For
   Aleppo is to allow visual artists an outlet to express themselves
   around the Syrian crisis and to raise awareness and funds to aid in
   the effort to provide Syrian children emergency care, food and
   water. You may donate (below) at any time or submit to the call
